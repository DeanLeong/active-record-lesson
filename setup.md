## Set up

To use this app

* Run `bundle install` (or just `bundle`)
* Run `rails db:reset`
  - This will create the database, run migrations, and [seed the data](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-garlic/LECTURE_U04_D06_Active-Record-101/blob/master/db/seeds.rb))
  - If the database already exists, it will drop it first
* To run the server:
  - In a new tab, run `rails server` (or just `rails s`)
* To open the console:
  - In a new tab, run `rails console` (or just `rails c`)
